### Targets

Forecasts will be made on a monthly basis for the presence of *Aedes aegypti* or *Ae. albopictus* in a subset of US counties.
 
### Monthly presence of *Ae. aegypti* **or** *Ae. albopictus*

**Definition**

Presence of either species for a given calendar month and county will be determined by collection data for adult mosquitoes from that month and county. If any adult mosquito of the species is collected on any day of the month, the species will be considered “present” for that month. If no adults are reported and trapping effort is reported and consistent with historical data for that county, the species will be considered “absent”. Final determinations will be made when final collection data from counties are available (December 2019 or later). Note that collection efforts are highly variable across counties and “absence”, as defined here, does not necessarily mean that the species is truly absent.

**Motivation**

Because of their role as vectors for arboviruses, *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* mosquitoes are targeted by many mosquito surveillance and control programs. Forecasts of where and when these mosquitoes are likely be found can help mosquito control agencies efficiently plan and implement these programs.
