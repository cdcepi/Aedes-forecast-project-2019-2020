### *Aedes* Forecasting Challenge 2019-2020

#### Monthly forecasts of *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* in a subset of U.S. counties
 
*Aedes aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* are the vectors of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, the most important arboviruses globally. These vectors are present across broad regions of the United States, but their spatiotemporal distribution is dynamic and not well understood. Data are limited and current models based on those data have not been evaluated on external data. Evaluating model-based, county-level forecasts on future data can help clarify model accuracy and utility, the seasonal and geographical dynamics of these species, and key directions for future research. These advances can contribute to improved preparedness for arboviral invasion in the U.S. and in other regions where *Aedes* suitability may be limited and changing.

**Challenge**

This is an _**open**_ forecasting challenge to predict the monthly presence of *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* in a subset of U.S. counties during the 2019 and 2020 calendar years. The forecasting targets are described on the [**Targets**]() page. The subset of counties are listed on the [**Data-2019**]() and [**Data-2020**]() pages along with historical data for each county. Participation guidelines are described on the [**Participation**]() page and evaluation criteria are described on the [**Evaluation**]() page.

**Timeline - 2019**
* Project announcement and data release: February 4, 2019.
* Data release completed: March 1, 2019. 
* Registration deadline: Teams may register up to Wednesday, March 27, 2019.
* Forecast deadlines: The first forecast should be for April, 2019 and is due on March 31, 2019 at 11:59 Eastern Standard Time (UTC−05:00). Forecasts for May through December are due at 11:59 EST on the final day of the preceding month (i.e. the 30th or 31st) with the last forecast due on November 30, 2019 (forecast for December, 2019).
* Forecast evaluation: Early 2020, as soon as final surveillance data for 2019 are available.

**Timeline - 2020**
* Project announcement and data release: May 1, 2020.

* Registration deadline: Teams may register up to Wednesday, May 27, 2020.
* Forecast deadlines: The first forecast should be for June, 2020 and is due on May 31, 2020 at 11:59 Eastern Standard Time (UTC−05:00). Forecasts for June through December are due at 11:59 EST on the final day of the preceding month (i.e. the 30th or 31st) with the last forecast due on November 30, 2020 (forecast for December, 2020).
* Forecast evaluation: Early 2021, as soon as final surveillance data for 2020 are available.
