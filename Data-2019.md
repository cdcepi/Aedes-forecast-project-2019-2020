### Mosquito surveillance data

The data are now complete for 95 counties in 8 states (as of March 1, 2019 - previously only a subset had been provided). There are at least two years of historical data for each participating county (2017-2018), but some have many more. The surveillance methods employed for each county are different and may vary over time (e.g. many counties do not trap in the winter months). The compiled data include indicators of trapping effort including trap type, number of collections, and number of trap nights by county. Forecasters should assume that trapping effort for each county will be similar in 2019 to what was reported for 2018. Forecasts for counties with substantially different trapping effort in 2019 will be analyzed separately and not included in overall scores.

The data are provided in standardized csv files below with one file for each state (including all participating counties). A detailed description of the fields included in these csv files is also included below. 

Other data sources may also be used for forecasting. There are no restrictions as to what data may be used. Forecasters may use as many data sources as they wish, but all should be listed in the model description (see [Participation](https://github.com/cdcepi/Aedes-forecast-project-2019-2020/blob/main/Participation.md) page). Links to potentially useful environmental data sources are included below on this page.

### Data Dictionary
 
The dataset includes monthly adult *Ae. aegypti* and *Ae. albopictus* trapping data by trap type. This includes data on the total trapping effort (number of sites, trap nights, and collections) and the collections of both species (number of positive collections and number of adults collected). Each line represents all collections for a single county in a single month with a single trap type. Note that some counties have multiple lines for a single month because they employed more than one trap type.
 
**DESCRIPTION OF VARIABLES**

**state**

State of collection

Examples: Florida, California

**statefp**

Two digit FIPS code for state of collection: [https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html).

Examples: 12, 06

**county**

County of collection, without the word "County"

Examples: Broward, Los Angeles

**countyfp**

Three digit FIPS code for county of collection: [https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html)

Examples: 011, 037

**year**

Four digit year of collection

Examples: 2016, 2017

**month**

Numeric month of collection (1-12)

Examples: 1, 10

**trap\_type**

Type of trap used for collection, includes: 
* BGS: BG sentinel traps including those baited with CO2
* GAT: Traps that target gravid *Aedes* females with enclosed water containers including BGGAT and AGO traps.
* GRAV: Traps that target gravid females with open water containers including CDC gravid traps. These traps target *Culex* species but may also detect Aedes species.
* CO2: Traps baited with CO2 including CDC and ABC light traps and Fay-Prince traps (BG sentinel traps using CO2 are classified as BGS) .

For collections where only presence or absence was recorded, “-PRES” is included at the end of the trap type name. 

**num\_sites**

Number of distinct trap sites

**num\_collection\_events**

Number of distinct trap collections. This may be less than the number of trap nights when a trap was set for multiple nights.

**num\_trap\_nights**

Cumulative number of nights distinct traps were run at all sites

**num\_aegypti\_collected**

Number of collected mosquitoes identified as *Aedes aegypti*. This may not be available and marked as NA in the case that collections were classified as present or absent rather than counting the number of mosquitoes. If only presence or absence was recorded for a trap, that is indicated in num\_collections\_aegypti.

**num\_albopictus\_collected**

Number of collected mosquitoes identified as *Aedes albopictus*. This may not be available and marked as NA in the case that collections were classified as present or absent rather than counting the number of mosquitoes. If only presence or absence was recorded for a trap, that is indicated in num\_collections\_albopictus.

**num\_collections\_aegypti**

Number of collections where *Aedes aegypti* were detected.

**num\_collections\_albopictus**

Number of collections where *Aedes albopictus* were detected.
